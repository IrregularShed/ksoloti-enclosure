# Ksoloti enclosure

Just a quick, 3D printable case for the [Ksoloti Core](https://ksoloti.github.io/) board. I made this while I was trying to decide what to do with my Ksoloti and didn't want it just knocking around on my desk unprotected.

Provided as .3mf files because I've not used .stl files for _years_.

The bottom has space for a couple of stereo 3.5mm jacks for audio in and out that can be connected to the header - not the most glamorous way of doing things but I'd already soldered the header on (and I knew it wasn't going to be in this case forever). I printed in PLA+ with a support for the wall beside the buttons. You'll need four M3x10 machine screws to hold it together, they screw in from underneath and bite directly into the plastic. I use socket head screws for more or less everything, so that's what it's designed for.

It looks like this when it's assembled...
